*This analysis uses R
This Project Reads Data from three Data source(CSV files) namely:

item_master.csv
inventory_weekly_summary.csv
sales_order-csv

The first set of code researches on how averages on a combined dataset can give skewed results and how to structure the dataset in the right way to make the accurate analysis.
The analysis reveals some key metrics like average units sold every week, sum of avg units sold across all items for the whole time period and the top customer with highest units bought

The second set analyses the inventory of all the items by item number and category
this analysis Joins two tables : inventory_weekly_summary and item_master to find the average inventory levels of each item and category
This also gives insight into the cost spent in holding the inventory.

THANK YOU!
